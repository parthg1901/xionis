# Welcome to XIONIS  

**XIONIS** is an innovative cross-chain lending platform that bridges the gap between the Cosmos and EVM ecosystems, providing seamless and efficient access to decentralized finance.  

## The Problems We Solve  

1. **Complexity of Access**:  
   Accessing the **Cosmos** and **CosmWasm** ecosystems can be intimidating for crypto beginners accustomed to EVM chains like **Arbitrum** and **Avalanche**. XIONIS simplifies this process, allowing users to leverage their existing stablecoins to secure loans on our platform without the steep learning curve.  

2. **Inefficiencies in Collateralization**:  
   Borrowers often face high collateralization requirements. With XIONIS, we solve this by using the **Reclaim Protocol** to calculate credit scores. For users with favorable scores—e.g., those not found involved in malicious activities like rug pulls—collateral requirements are reduced, making borrowing more accessible and equitable.  

3. **Limited Ecosystem Support in Cross-Chain Lending**:  
   By 2023, the total value locked (TVL) in cross-chain bridges surpassed **$10 billion**, but the majority was concentrated in EVM ecosystems. As more users join the blockchain ecosystem, it’s crucial to create a user-friendly platform that extends the benefits of cross-chain DeFi to non-EVM chains like **XION** and beyond.

## Key Features  

### 1. Dynamic Collateralization  
XIONIS integrates **Pyth's price feed** to dynamically assess and update collateral values in real-time. This ensures borrowers always get fair terms based on current market conditions.  

### 2. Credit Scoring with Reclaim Protocol  
We leverage the **Reclaim Protocol** to analyze user histories and calculate credit scores. Borrowers with positive credit records benefit from reduced collateral requirements, making the platform more inclusive and rewarding for responsible users.  

### 3. Governance-Driven Ecosystem  
Borrowers earn **governance tokens** for participating on the platform. These tokens enable them to vote on key proposals, ensuring the community has a say in shaping the future of XIONIS.  

### 4. Cross-Chain Compatibility  
XIONIS provides seamless access for users from EVM ecosystems, allowing them to bring their stablecoins and interact effortlessly with the **Cosmos** and **XION** ecosystems.
